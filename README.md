# Introduction
The reviewed dataset contains information about over 10,000 movies gathered from The Movie Databased (TMDb) including users ratings and revenue.

Some people see movie industry as being very creative, it still remains a high-cost business where the cost of failure can be fatal.

In this analysis we will try to understand how much would it cost to produce a movie, how much profit different genres are generating in average and what genre might be more fail-proof.

### Questions to be covered during analysis
- What genres usually generate more revenue? Does the genre that ends up high-revenue one remains the most profitable?
- How much it cost to produce a movie in average - per genre?
- How the median production cost been changing over time? Per genre?
- How the average movie profit changed over time for movies with high, medium and low production costs?

### Conclusions

**NOTE: the conclusion wasn't evaluated on subject of statistical significance, and therefore is tentative.
As a target for analysis, we wanted to understand the cost of movie production, and evaluate what genre could be the most fail-proof within the range of the given dataset.

After cleaning the data and finishing with slightly below 5,000 observations we can draft below conclusions:

Movie industry is heavily driven by blockbusters, what makes the analysis quite complicated. However, the usage of median value helps to prevent the influence of outliers on the overall dataset, what gives more meaning to the analysis.
Median value analysis demonstrated that genres like Animation, Adventure and Family generate higher median profits than others, and therefore, could be a safer bet for production.
However, production cost of all three genres was growing over time, what makes these genres not the best opportunity for beginning producers. However, Horror or Thriller are relatively stable in terms of production costs and are generating positive profits, even though it is not as high in average vs. Animation.
The majority of producers are aiming for medium production costs. However, as profitability is growing for high and low-production movies, it is recommended to aim either into high- or low- cost categories.
